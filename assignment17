 Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field
 1)create table order1(
     amount   float(7,2),
     odate  date,
     onum int(4),
     snum  int(4),
     cnum  int(4),
     primary key(onum,snum,cnum)
     );
	 
Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
2)   create table salespeople1(
  comm   float(7,2)  default .10 not null,
  snum  int(4) primary key,
  sname char(20) 
    check (substr(upper(sname),1,1) between 'A' and 'M')
    );
	
	Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
3) create table  order2(
     snum int(4) not null,
	 cnum int(4) not null
	 check( cnum>snum),
	  onum int(4) not null
	  check(onum>snum)
	  );
